## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learned how to create variables for future use in the CSS of the project.


```css
:root {
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
